# OpenAPI Generator(s)

This OG Automation tool is pretty powerful, but it has unique challenges for each module.

## Limitations

While the OpenAPI Generator is a powerful tool for automating the generation of code and documentation from OpenAPI specifications, it is not without its limitations. Some limitations to be aware of include:

- **Different limitations for each generator**: As you mentioned, each generation module is created and supported by different developers, which means that each generator has different limitations and configurations that need to be set. This can make it challenging to use the OpenAPI Generator for certain use cases or with certain languages.

- **Limited support for some languages**: While the OpenAPI Generator supports a wide range of programming languages, there may be some languages or frameworks that are not supported. Be sure to check the OpenAPI Generator documentation to see which languages and frameworks are supported.

- **Limited support for some OpenAPI features**: While the OpenAPI Generator supports most OpenAPI features, there may be some features that are not fully supported. This can make it challenging to use the OpenAPI Generator for certain use cases or with certain OpenAPI specifications.

## Roadmap

To address some of these limitations and make it easier for developers to use the OpenAPI Generator with a wide range of languages and frameworks, this project has several items on its roadmap, including:

- **Improved support for custom configurations**: To help developers work around the limitations of each generator, we plan to provide improved support for custom configurations, allowing developers to tweak the settings of each generator to better suit their needs.

- **Improved error handling**: To make it easier for developers to troubleshoot issues with the OpenAPI Generator, we plan to improve the error handling and error messages provided by the tool.

- **Expanded language support**: While the OpenAPI Generator already supports a wide range of programming languages, we plan to expand support for additional languages and frameworks in the future.
